Power
=====

You would put the voltage regulator on top of the board.  It's hard to solder stuff under there.

THe wires between yoru battery and the jumper need to be high-current.

DRC
=====

ok.

Motor holders
=====

the sides of your motor holders need to be thicker.


Pours
=====

YOur jumper is a long way from teh battery (and close to the propellers -- ouch!).  I would extend your VBAT and BAT_GND pours to come closer to the battery terminals.  It'll make all the wires shorter and get the jumper away from the props.

THe hole in your GND pour is bigger than it needs to be and it's causing a bunch of extra wires.  The whole under the IMU only need to be right under the IMU.  ANd it's better if the whole is smaller.

I would also put GND on layer 2 and power on underneath that.



Antenna
=====

Your antenna is surrounded by a faraday cage.  It should stick out!  See red board.

The wires to your antenna need to be straight (as possible), parallel and the same length.


Oscillator
=====

ok.

decoupling
=====

Your decoupling caps are too far from teh IMU and microcontroller.  Same for the other caps that connect pins to ground through caps.


Voltage regulator
=====

ok.


Reset button
=====

YOu don't have a reset button.

Jumper
=====

see above.

Misc
=====

You are using the wrong diode.  you want the 360-MV part.

THe pads on your mosfets are too small.  See page 6 of datasheet.
