1.  DEN_A/G is not connected

2.  missing pullup resistors

3.  RFP and RFN on your balun are backwards.  Pins 1 and 5 are backwards too.

4.  The resistance for your green leds is too high.  Think about why.


other notes:

1.  It's conventionla to put VCC at the top and gnd on the bottom.  You have them on side in your motor contorllers.

2.  It's confusing that your the power symbol attached ot your vbat lines is labeled VCC  VBAT would be much clearer.

3.  You could have reused the LED symbol for your custom LEDs

4.  I'm worried your custom LEDs may be too dimm.  Check upper-left graph on page 3 of the datasheet.
