1.  DEN_A/G is not connected - fixed

2.  missing pullup resistors - fixed

3.  RFP and RFN on your balun are backwards.  Pins 1 and 5 are backwards too.

4.  The resistance for your green leds is too high.  Think about why. - fixed


other notes:

1.  It's conventionla to put VCC at the top and gnd on the bottom.  You have them on side in your motor contorllers. -- Fixed

2.  It's confusing that your the power symbol attached ot your vbat lines is labeled VCC  VBAT would be much clearer. -- Fixed

3.  You could have reused the LED symbol for your custom LEDs -- True

4.  I'm worried your custom LEDs may be too dimm.  Check upper-left graph on page 3 of the datasheet.

Your vreg out put is not connected V.

Your regulated 3-volt signal is not calle 3V.

AVDD and DVDD have the wrong caps.

TX and R:X on your serial port are backwards. (see red board)

C24 should connect to BAT_GND
