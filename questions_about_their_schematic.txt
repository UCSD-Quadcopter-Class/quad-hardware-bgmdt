- 0805_RESISTOR.pac
	- Silkscreen goes over P$1 and P$2 when it should not.
- RESISTOR.sym
	- >VALUE should be in tValues not tNames
- RESISTOR.dev
	- No prefix set

- RED_LED.pac
	- Silkscreen goes over P$1 and P$2
	- Confused where you got your pad dimensions from, but they exceed what is necessary so alright.
- LED.sym
	- Symbol isn't quite right, not conventional LED symbol.
	- Symbol has C and A backwards
- LED.dev
	- No prefix set

- MOSFET.pac
	- Silkscreen crosses pins
	- P$1 and P$2 have different X coordinates
- MOSFET.sym
	- Looks good
- MOSFET.dec
	- No prefix set

- IMU.pac
	- Silkscreen crosses pins
	- No indicator for first pin/placement (indicator is reversed and is on pin 18)
- IMU.sym
	- Pins are mirrored, made according to bottom view when they should all be flipped
- IMU.dev
	- Pins are wrong because symbol is wrong
	- No prefix set

- NET_BRIDGE does not pass eagle-lint
- NET_BRIDGE.pac
	- Missing name
	- Not sure if we need outline
- NET_BRIDGE.sym
	- Symbol missing pins?
- NET_BRIDGE.dev
	- No pins
	- Missing Attributes -- Creator/Reviewer/*

LEDs.lbr
If this is unused then whatever but not sure if it is
- LED.pac
	- Pads are not as big as specified in the datasheet
	- NAME and value overlap
	- Cathode and anode are reversed (anode is pos)
- LED.sym
	- no pins
- LED.pac
	- pins not connected
	- no prefix set
	



Schematic
	- Voltage Regulator
		- Obviously we don't know, but since our goal is to keep noise low, the optional
		  bypass cap should be included
		- No specified V_BAT line 
	- IMU
		- Not sure but does mirroring in schematic translate to mirroring in the board?
			- If not, IMU will be messed up
		- SDO_A/G should be tied high to set the bit to 1
		- SDO_M should be tied low to set the bit to 0
	- Motor Driver
		- C19, C21, C23, C25 are all non-polar caps. In the motor driver schematic provided, they are polarized caps.
		- On Library Update: "Warning Following devicesets are used in schematic but have not been found in the corresponding update library: Lab2.lbr MOSFET-S...."
		- MOSFET in schematic =/= any in library
		- C20, C22, C24, C26 from external library: capacitor-wima
		- BAT_GND should be used in place of GND to reduce noise
	- Microcontroller:
		- Part 748421245 not in our libarary. Use corresponding part from our quadparts_prebuilt lib
		- Same with antenna
		- And Crystal
	- Pin Header
		- Pin header connected directly to voltage regulator, and does not contain GND_BAT
	- FTDI/J1
		- I'm guessing these should be from quadparts_prebuilt as well.
