We designed our LEDs to be running the entire time the quad is on.
They are wired in series, so we do not need a resistor.

We designed the package using the suggested pad sizes from this document: http://www.kingbrightusa.com/images/catalog/SPEC/APT2012ZGCK.pdf
It is included in datasheets/LEDs/APT2012ZGCK.pdf
