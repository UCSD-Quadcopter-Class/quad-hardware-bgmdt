* Schematic:
   * Documentation
      * Are all the names and values visible?
      * Is the schematic layed out nicely?  Is it organized?
   * Connectivity
      * Are all non-connected nets labeled?
      * Are all pins on all parts connected?  If not, why?  -I don’t think the the motors are powered by the voltage regulator. Pretty sure they need to be? Would need to double check this with the professor
      * Are all the grounds connected? Is there only one ground net?  -No, all grounds are connected, but not to one net
      * Are all the Vdds connected?  Is each power pin attached to the right power supply?  
      * Are all the pins actually connected?  Or do they just look connected? (drag parts around to see)  -No, FTDI (placed on the right) is not  connected to RX1, TX1, GND. P$1 of the MOSFETS are not connected on any of the motors
      * Are there junctions at net crossings where there shouldn’t be?  Are junctions missing where they should be present?
   * Functionality
      * Does the schematic do what it’s supposed to?
      * Why was the value of each resistors and cap chosen?  -Information was provided by the professor? So Yes? 
      * Are the decoupling caps the right size?  -Unsure how to check this.
